# Energy-based non-linear calibration in NIRS

## Abstract
The success of multivariate calibration depends on the generalizability of the underlying regression models, for which the spectral features are usually decorrelated in a preliminary step. In order to also allow the application of deep neural networks like transformers, this presentation introduces a powerful approach to highly non-linear decorrelation of spectral features using deep energy based modeling.
